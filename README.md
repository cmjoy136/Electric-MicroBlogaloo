# microblog
v0.1 Created microblog using virtual env and packages to display hello world to the interweb
v0.2 This is where I messed up the first time so I redid it for this. created templates for users and posts to visualize the aspects on html.
v0.3 Added more functionality to forms using Flask-WTF, inlcuding form validation, and data requirements. refactored redirects for links using url_for() to avoid potential issues with assigning links
